As part of the [CI-H](http://web.mit.edu/commreq/cih.html) subject requirements, there will be a total of 20 pages of written assignments in class. The written assignments will be divided into 2 reaction / reflection papers, 5 pages each. In addition there will be a 10–12 page final research paper.

Papers should be typed, double spaced, using Times New Roman 12, and follow the [Chicago Manual of Style](http://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/home.html) instructions for footnotes, bibliography etc.

Reaction / Reflection Papers
----------------------------

The reaction / reflection papers will be based on readings, lectures, class discussion, and movies discussed during the course, and may address a specific question assigned by the professor. Their goal is to allow the students to reflect critically on what they have read and discussed during the different sessions.

Final Research Paper
--------------------

The 10–12 page research paper must describe and analyze some aspect of the contemporary Middle East. It may focus on a specific individual or event, the history of an idea, significant work, etc. To the greatest extent possible, it should be based on primary sources. A topic proposal is due during Week 7. The proposal should consist of the statement of the topic you intend to investigate, a preliminary outline, a list of the major sources you will use. It does not need to be longer than a page and must be approved by me in advance. The final paper is due a week after the last class.
